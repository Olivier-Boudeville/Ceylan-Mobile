# Ceylan-Mobile
Part of the Ceylan project in charge of the control of mobile phones from Erlang.

A typical use case is to send SMS from Erlang thanks to a connected 3G USB key.

Ceylan-Mobile is based on:
* [libGammu](https://wammu.eu/libgammu/), for the mobile phone support
* [Ceylan-Seaplus](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Seaplus), for the integration of the previous library to Erlang
